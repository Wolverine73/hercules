5          | LOCATION: /PRG/sastest1/hercules
6          |
7          | PURPOSE:  This macro is a "wrapper" for the following "file release" process
8          |           macros:
9          |
10         |             (1) %check_document          - ensures that pending files have
11         |                                            valid APN_CMCTN_IDs.
12         |             (2) %complete_data_cleansing - carries updates made by the user
13         |                                            into the pending file.
14         |             (3) %release_data            - determines the contents of the
15         |                                            final output based on the file
16         |                                            usage type code, and sends it to
17         |                                            the appropriate destination.
18         |
19         |           The purpose of this macro is to simplify the manner by which
20         |           the file release macros are invoked by SAS IT and Java.
21         |
22         | INPUT:    MACRO PARMS:
23         |
24         |             INIT_ID  = (Default: &INITIATIVE_ID)
25         |             PHASE_ID = (Default: &PHASE_SEQ_NB)
26         |             COM_CD   = (Default: &CMCNT_ROLE_CD)
27         |
28         | OUTPUT:   See individual macros for more detailed descriptions of the impact
29         |           of the specific macro calls initiated by this program.  The output
30         |           is in general a final output file/dataset, updated system tables,
31         |           status reports and email notification to users/client.
32         |
33         | CALLED PROGRAMS:
34         |
35         |   %ISNULL                  - to determine the presence of required parameters.
36         |   %CHECK_DOCUMENT          - as described above.
37         |   %COMPLETE_DATA_CLEANSING - as described above.
