 |  MACRO NAME:     PULL_QL_RETAIL_CLAIMS.SAS
 |
 |  PURPOSE:    TARGETS A CLIENT WHO WOULD LIKE A CUSTOM PROACTIVE MAILING.  THIS
 |              IS A ONE TIME MAILING.
 |              -- Select clients and CPGs

 |              -- do not target if Mail service was used within last 90 days
 |              -- This run for QL only
 |  INPUT:      &claimsa..&claim_his_tbl
 |              &claimsa..TDRUG1
 |
 |  OUTPUT:     Standard datasets in /results and /pending directories

 |  HISTORY:    MAY 2008 - CARL STARKS  Hercules Version  2.1.01
 |                        This is a new macro created to pull claims for QL 
 |                         the logic is the same from the original program.
 |                         the logic was move from the program and made into a macro
 |                         the only change was the input and output files names are
 |                         passed to the macro using macro variables tbl_name_out
 |                         and tnl_name_in
